# README
## This is the README for your extension "MultiEdit"

Hello! This color theme is heavily inspired by the old-school
MS-DOS editor MultiEdit 5.0, maybe someone will find it useful.
Thanks!

Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets

**Enjoy!**
